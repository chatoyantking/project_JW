WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net Image_Process_Edge/Edge_Check0/inst/CLK0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Image_Process_Edge/Edge_Check0/inst/Image_Line_Buffer00_i_1/O, cell Image_Process_Edge/Edge_Check0/inst/Image_Line_Buffer00_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PLHOLDVIO-2] Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations: A LUT Image_Process_Edge/Edge_Check0/inst/Image_Line_Buffer00_i_1 is driving clock pin of 808 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
