Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.

WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net Driver_HDMI0/Set_X_reg[5]_0[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Driver_HDMI0/Address_reg[13]_i_1/O, cell Driver_HDMI0/Address_reg[13]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net Image_Process_Edge/Edge_Check0/inst/CLK0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Image_Process_Edge/Edge_Check0/inst/Image_Line_Buffer00_i_1/O, cell Image_Process_Edge/Edge_Check0/inst/Image_Line_Buffer00_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PLHOLDVIO-2] Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations: A LUT Image_Process_Edge/Edge_Check0/inst/Image_Line_Buffer00_i_1 is driving clock pin of 808 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
